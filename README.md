# PokemonGame

An implementation of a simplified version of the Pokémon franchise in C++. 
In this game, players act as trainers who search for and catch pocket monsters (Pokémon), train them, and engage in battles against other Pokémon.
The game revolves around two main pieces of information: the list of available Pokémon and the list of Pokémon caught by the user. 
The list of available Pokémon, consisting of 151 monsters, is provided in the proj2_pokeDex.txt file, including information such as Pokémon number, name, maximum combat points (CP), and rarity.

### About

the program is menu driven; 
The main menu offers options to display the complete PokeDex, display the user's team, search for new Pokémon, battle Pokémon, train Pokémon, or exit the game.
The project involves implementing two classes: Pokemon and Game. The Pokemon class requires straightforward implementation of functions provided in the header file. 
Each team can have between 0 and 4 Pokémon.

  - displaying available Pokémon
  - managing the user's Pokémon collection
